# GitHub Commit Plan

Committing the portfolio site to a GitHub repository to enable version control and sharing.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] Preparation
#### [MODIFY] [.gitignore](file:///d:/Work_Station/My_Portfolio/.gitignore)
- Added Next.js build artifacts, environment files, and agent-specific directories to ignore list.

### Local Commit
- Initialized git identity for `Kazi-Aryan`.
- Staged all files and created an initial commit: "Initial commit: Portfolio site foundation".

### Remote Push
- Create repository `My_Portfolio` on GitHub (Pending permission/User action).
- Add remote and push `main` branch.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- `git status` to verify clean working directory.
- `git log` to verify commit history.

### Manual Verification
- Verify the repository exists on GitHub and contains the latest code.
